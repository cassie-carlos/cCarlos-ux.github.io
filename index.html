									<h2>The Life Jacket</h2>
								</header>
								<p>
									&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp The Life Jacket is a product that was made to be used during natural disasters. Its features are activated by a protected button located on the sleeve of the jacket, the features include: flashing lights, 
									the sending of Morse code messages through the beeps of a buzzer, sending of GPS location via SMS (text message), and remote triggering through a radio frequency remote that activates the other functions of the jacket as well. 
									<br>
									&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp This project won me and my team first place out of the 20+ teams that perticipated in our school's Project Based Learning (PBL) in which judges from organizations such as DOST appraised the works.

										<br>
										&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp This was my very first big project in iAcademy, we were tasked with creating wearable technology to solve a problem in the Philippines; the problem we chose to address was 
										the excessive amount of time it takes to find survivors in natural disasters. At the time of our brainstorming for the project, there was a massive landslide in Naga, Cebu.
										It took over a week for rescuers to finally finish their search, with majority being found dead. Of course, after hearing the tragedy, my team wanted to create a device to help 
										in any way we could in such situations, and where we saw we could intervene was in helping rescuers find survivors more quickly.
										<br><br>
										&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Below is the concept board my team and I submitted to the Adobo Design Awards, in which we managed to be one of the few finalists from Senior HighSchool.

									<h2>Aquainted</h2>
								</header>
								<p>
									&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Aquainted is a web application built using the Java Spring framework with the goal of educating people about water sustainability, the struggles and importance of upkeeing it 
									as well as how people can contribute to mitigating the issue.
									<br>
									&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp With this project, my team and I placed 2nd in iAcademy's Project Based Learning for the 1st semester of our 12th year.
								</p>
								<section>
									<div class="row">
										<div class="col-9 col-12-medium">
											<a class="image fit"><img src="images/aquaintedHome.PNG"></a> 
										</div>
										<div class="col-3 col-12-small">
											<p>
												&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp While designing the application we aimed to appeal to audiences from all different ages. Hence the colorful choice of palette.
											</p>
										</div>
										<p>
											<br>
											&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp We also wanted to be a sort of "one-stop-shop" and first step into indivisual water sustainability. On the website here is a dedicated news page with a custom search engine that only shows results that relate 
											to water regardless of what is searched up. This is so that people can keep up to date with news relating to water and sustainability on our site.
										</p>
										<a class="image fit"><img src="images/aquaintedNewsPage.PNG"></a>
										<p>
											<br>
											&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp As an avenue to bring people to the large scale view of things, there is a page called the advocacy page where there is a button people can press to bring them to the donation page of a water sustainability focused charity.
										</p>
										<a class="image fit"><img src="images/aquaintedAdvocacy.PNG"></a>
										<p>
											<br>
											&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Of course we wanted to show people habits they can form to aid in lowering their water consumption so we offered two main ways to do so. One being a commitment page as shown in the first photo below and the other being a game. 
											(Both to be further explained below)
										</p>
										<div class="col-6 col-12-small">
											<a class="image fit"><img src="images/aquaintedCommitments.PNG"></a>
										</div>
										<div class="col-6 col-12-small">
											<a class="image fit"><img src="images/aquaintedGamePage.PNG"></a>
										</div>
										<p>
											<br>
											&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp First the commitment page, you get to this page by clicking a button located below the donation portion of the advocacy page, which would lead you to the screen below. On it - as you can see - is a list of commitments accompanied by a button 
											reading "I Understand". 
										</p>
										<a class="image fit"><img src="images/aquaintedCommitments2.PNG"></a>
										<div class="col-3 col-12-small">
											<p>
												&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp By clicking that button, you will recieve an email that looks like this daily. The email serves as a reminder with a randomized list of suggested water saving habits.
											</p>
										</div>
										<div class="col-9 col-12-medium">
											<a class="image fit"><img src="images/aquaintedEmail.PNG"></a> 
										</div>
										<p>
											<br>
											&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp For the game, as mentioned above we aimed to appeal to different age groups. That meant that we wanted to find a more engaging way to show the habit reminders for younger viewers. The way we saw fit to do so was 
											by making a game with a cute character and water saving related minigames. Below are a few screenshots.

								<p>
									&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp This project is from our Database class and as written in the title is a very basic CRUD system for a list of students. Meaning you can add student data to the masterlist, remove student data, edit data and delete it from the list all together. 
									To give some context, iJSD is iAcademy's software development and tutoring organization and it is headed by your truly.
